\begin{itemize}
\item With the transfer function written as
\[H(z) = \frac{b_0 z^n + b_{n-1} z^{n-1} + \cdots + b_1 z + b_n}{z^n + a_1 z^{n-1} + \cdots + a_{n-1} z + b_n}\]
there is a direct analogy with the general form of the continuous
system transfer function with $s$ instead of $z$. \item That was
implemented with the physically realistic integral operator $\int
dt$ for which the digital equivalent is the delay operator
$\nabla$.
