The equivalent of the differential equation model for continuous
systems is the difference equation for digital systems.

Replacing
the differential operator $\frac{d}{dt}$ by the advance operator
$\triangle$ gives the general form of the difference equation as
\begin{equation}\label{eq:l9e1}
  \triangle^ny + a_{1}\triangle^{n-1}y + \ldots +  a_n y = b_0
  \triangle^n u + b_{1}\triangle^{n-1} u + \ldots + b_n u.
\end{equation}
