The
response of a digital system with transfer function $H(z)$ to a
digital input signal $u$ is the digital output signal
$y$ given in transform form as
\begin{equation}\label{eq:l10e1}
  Y(z) =H(z) U(z)
\end{equation}
Taking the inverse transform gives the digital system response as
\begin{equation}\label{eq:l10e2}
  y_k = \mathcal{Z}^{-1}Y(z) = \mathcal{Z}^{-1} \left\{H(z)
  U(z)\right\}
\end{equation}
\endinput
