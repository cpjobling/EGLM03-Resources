By comparison with continuous integration $Y(s)/U(s)=1/s$, this result,
obtained by \emph{numerical integration} allows us to say that
$$s \approx \frac{2}{T}\{{\frac{1-z^{-1}}{1+z^{-1}}}\}.$$
This result is summarised in SLIDE~\ref{slide:l11s22}.

Similar arguments can be used to determine the forward- and backward-rectangular
approximations shown in SLIDES~\ref{slide:l11s20} and \ref{slide:l11s21}.
