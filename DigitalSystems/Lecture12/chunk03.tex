During each sample period, the device holds the output $v(t)$ constant
at the current value of the digital signal $v_k$. That is
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:l11e4}
  v(t) = v_k\ \mathrm{for}\ kT \le t < (k+1)T
\end{equation}
This generates a stepwise continuous signal $v(t)$ which at the
sampling instants is equal to the continuous signal from which the
digital signal ${v_k}$ was generated (\sref{slide:l11s3}).
