In many cases, e.g. signal processing, control systems, etc., we want to design
a digital system so that it behaves
(dynamically and in steady-state) the same as a continuous
system. A digital system that has the same input-behaviour as
a (sampled) continuous system is called a \emph{continuous
  equivalent}.
