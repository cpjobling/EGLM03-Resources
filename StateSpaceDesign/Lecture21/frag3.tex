\begin{itemize}
	\item These are the state equations for the observer error.
	\item The errors decay to zero with time if the eigen values of  $(\mathbf{A}-\mathbf{LC})$ lie in the left half plane (LHP).
	\item In fact we can design the matrix $\mathbf{L}$ to place the eigen values anywhere we wish
	\item If we place them well into the LHP then $\mathbf{e}$ will decay quickly to zero making the observer states accurately track the system states $\mathbf{x}$ after a short time.
	\item $\hat{\mathbf{x}}$ can then be used for feedback control.
