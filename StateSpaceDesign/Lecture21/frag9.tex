In the error equation, the sensor noise is multiplied by $\mathbf{L}$ and the process noise is not. Therefore,
\begin{enumerate}
	\item if $\mathbf{L}$ is very small, the effect of sensor noise $v$ is removed but the observer is ``slow'' to respond, so that the error will not reject the effect of $w$ very well.
	\item if $\mathbf{L}$ is large, the observer response is ``fast'' and the error rejects the process noise $w$ well, but the sensor noise $v$ is amplified by $\mathbf{L}$ resulting in large errors.
\end{enumerate}

Optimal control design methods can be used to achieve the ``best'' compromise.
