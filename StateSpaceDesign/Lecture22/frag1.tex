\begin{itemize}
	\item The observer states can be used to provide feedback control when the plant's own states are not available. 
	\item The combined observer-controller is equivalent to a classical compensator. 
	\item The combined system has twice as many states as the plant because of the duplicated states of the observer. 
	\item \emph{Question to be answered here}: how does the whole thing behave?
