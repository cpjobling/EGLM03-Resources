\begin{itemize}
	\item Notice here how the input TF $F(s)$ contains as its zeros all the poles of the observer given by $\alpha_e(s)$.
	\item Because of the separation principle, these are also half of the poles of the overall closed loop TF.
	\item The pole-zero cancellation results in the final TF having just the plant zeros and the controller poles.
	\item Thus we can say that, using the observer states for the feedback, instead of the unavailable plant states, has not affected the closed loop TF.
	\item This is not the case when the reference input is introduced elsewhere.
\end{itemize}
