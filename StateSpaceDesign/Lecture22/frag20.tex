We know from previous work that the denominator, corresponding to the closed loop CE of the overall system must, from the separation principle, be equivalent to:
\[
\alpha_e(s)\alpha_c(s)
\]
therefore,
\[
\frac{{Y(s)}}{{R(s)}} = \frac{{\alpha _e (s)\alpha _z (s)}}{{\alpha _e (s)\alpha _c (s)}} = \frac{{\alpha _z (s)}}{{\alpha _c (s)}}
\]
