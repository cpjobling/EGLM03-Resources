The matrix is block triangular with square matrices on the diagonal. Therefore:
\[
	\det \left[ {s{\bf{I}} - \left( {{\bf{A}} - {\bf{BK}}} \right)} \right]\det\left[ {s{\bf{I}} - \left( {{\bf{A}} - {\bf{LC}}} \right)} \right] = 0 
\]
\[
	\alpha_c(s)\alpha_e(s) = 0 
\]
 

These are the combined characteristic polynomials of the controller and the observer.
