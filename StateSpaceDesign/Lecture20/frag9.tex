The last example had a system TF with no zeros. In this case it is easy to construct the equivalent classical controller. We had the feedback law:
\[
u=r-5x_1-156x_2
\]

Now $y=7x_2$ and $\dot{x}_2=x_1$ therefore $X_2(s)=Y(s)/7$ and $X_1(s)=sX_2(s)=sY(s)/7$. Therefore
\begin{eqnarray*}
	U(s) & = & R(s)-rX_1(s)-156X_2(s) \\
	& = & R(s) - \frac{1}{7}(5s+156)Y(s)
\end{eqnarray*}
