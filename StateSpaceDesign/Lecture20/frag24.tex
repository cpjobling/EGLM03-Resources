\begin{itemize}
	\item In general the Bessel polynomials have too much damping for normal applications â€“- it is preferable to use ITAE (or Butterworth) poles if some overshoot is acceptable.
	\item If zeros are present they tend to ``sharpen up'' the transient response (faster rise times but consequently with more overshoot). In such cases it may be desirable to place a closed loop pole on top of a troublesome zero and work with the reduced order system as above.
	\item The poles closest to the origin matter most; other poles give rise to shorter-term transients only and may need only to be shifted to a better damped location, if necessary, at a similar frequency (distance from the origin).
\end{itemize}
