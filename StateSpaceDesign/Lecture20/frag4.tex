Finally, we need to find the $k$  coefficients in $\mathbf{K}$ such that the polynomials in equations  (\ref{eq:1})  and  \ref{eq:2}) above have matching coefficients in each power of $s$.

This leads to a set of linear equations in the $k$'s  which can always be solved to give the required feedback control law, for whatever closed loop pole locations are given.
