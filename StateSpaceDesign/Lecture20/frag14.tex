From Matlab CST, \verb|help acker|:
\verb|K = ACKER(A,B,P)|  calculates the feedback gain matrix $\mathbf{K}$ such that
the single input system
\[
\dot{\mathbf{x}}=\mathbf{Ax}+\mathbf{B}u
\]
with a feedback law of  $u = -\mathbf{Kx}$  has closed loop poles at the 
values specified in vector $\mathbf{P}$, i.e.,  \texttt{P = eig(A-B*K)}.

\textbf{Note}: This algorithm uses Ackermann's formula.  This method
is NOT numerically reliable and starts to break down rapidly
for problems of order greater than 10, or for weakly controllable
systems.  A warning message is printed if the nonzero closed-loop
poles are greater than 10\% from the desired locations specified 
in $\mathbf{P}$.
