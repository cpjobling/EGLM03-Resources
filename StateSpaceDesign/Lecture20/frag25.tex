A most effective technique is to use optimal control to achieve a compromise between control effort, $u$, and error, $e$.
i.e. Find the feedback vector $\mathbf{K}$ such as to minimise,
\[
J=\int_0^{\infty}\left(e^2+\frac{u^2}{k}\right) dt
\]
where the choice of the parameter $k$ determines the required compromise between,
\begin{itemize}
	\item High Accuracy for High Control Effort (use a large value for $k$)
	\item Lower Accuracy for Reduced Control Effort (use a smaller value for $k$)
\end{itemize}
