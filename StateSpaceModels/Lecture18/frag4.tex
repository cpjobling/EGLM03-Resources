In particular, the solution of:
\[
\frac{d\mathbf{x}}{dt}=\mathbf{Ax}
\]
given $\mathbf{x}=\mathbf{x}_0$ at $t=0$ is:
\[
\mathbf{x}=e^{\mathbf{A}t}\mathbf{x}_0
\]
               
The term  $\mathbf{\phi}(t) = e^{\mathbf{A}t}$  is known as the state transition matrix because it shows how time, $t$, transforms the initial state vector into the present one.
